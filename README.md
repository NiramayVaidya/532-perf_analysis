# 532-perf_analysis

Hardware performance evaluation for the "Association Rule Mining" application.
</br>
The pthreads and the serial implementation (multi-core CPU) can be found in the main branch.
</br>
ThE CUDA implementation (GPU) can be found in the simple_bitmap branch.
</br>
For more information on how to execute the pthreads and the serial codes together, refer to driver.md in the main branch. For all other helper codes, refer to their respective md files.
</br>
For more information on how to execute the CUDA code, refer to the README.md in the simple_bitmap branch.
